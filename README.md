# API Resilience Fork – CVE Remediation & CI/CD Gates

This repository is a **resilience fork** of an API codebase, maintained with a strict security-first process.

## Objectives
- Continuous **CVE remediation**
- Clean, traceable **security patch history**
- **CI/CD quality gates** (tests, coverage, vulnerability scans)
- A **deploy-ready branch** at any time

## Key Deliverables
- **Code & Artifacts:** secured fork with commits dedicated to security fixes
- **Process:** CI pipeline failing on new CVEs or reduced coverage
- **Documentation:** deployment runbook and CVE catalog

## Documentation
- [CVE Catalog](CVE_CATALOG.md)
- [Deployment Runbook](DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
