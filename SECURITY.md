# Security Policy

## Reporting
Security issues should be reported responsibly via a private channel.

## Patch Discipline
- All security patches must reference a CVE or advisory.
- Commits must be minimal, traceable and documented.
- CI must pass before merge (tests, coverage, vulnerability scan).
